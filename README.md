# Information-Theory-In-Neuroscience-Implementation

Applied machine learning and information theory to understand neural information processing and improve the robustness of existing neuroscience models.
Implemented Izhikevich neuron models to simulate neural activity. and analyzed neuron interactions using mutual information, transfer entropy, and partial information decomposition.
